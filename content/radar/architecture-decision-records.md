title: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
---

True agile projects follow an emergent architecture, changing both functional
and non-functional requirements along its entire lifecycle. Those changes
require decision-making and updates to its backing material.

Documentation is good, yet long-winded wikis or multi-paged documents are hardly
maintained, let alone read. Even worse if those decisions are stored as slide
decks. Those are wasteful forms of information dumping that don't pay off.

In 2011 [Michael Nygard][michael-nygard] shared the [idea of creating
architecture decision records (ADRs)][adrs]: plain-text, independent markdown
files with key topics. Those files contains all the context needed for the
decision-making process and the consequences of it. They're then versioned and
stored the same way as code.

ADRs allows tracking historical reasoning in a clean and concise way.

You can find the original template and scripts from Nygard plus variations in
the community-driven  [ADR GitHub organization][gh-adr].
I personally like the [MADR template][madr-template] due to its short questions
that reminds you of important content to fill in.
