Understanding the domain of a problem, creating an ubiquitous language and
communicating using it is essential. Problems grow ever complex with novel
business challenges. A design must reflect those in a way that's simple to all
stakeholders to understand and work with.

[Erick Evans' blue book][ddd-book] is an excellent resource about the practice
and a must-read for any serious engineer working on real-world solutions.
