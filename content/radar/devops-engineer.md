title: DevOps Engineer
---

DevOps is a body of knowledge, a set of practices to bridge the gap between
development and operations and make it as seamless as possible. In that sense,
a DevOps engineer exists as much as an Ethical engineer. Yet I don't see job
offerings in asking for the latter.

What the market calls a DevOps engineer is the system administrator or operators
of yore. They now sports a new role name as if its the panacea for any
engineering process issues. In practice what we see are professionals with low
interest in programming and tool-driven problem-solving views pushing their
favorite toolkit everywhere they go.

Don't get me wrong, I've accepted DevOps roles in the past and I also have my
preferences, as seen in this website and radar. Yet the urge to solve problems
as a software engineer keeps those preferences at bay until I'm confident that's
indeed the most appropriate option.

The lack of software engineering experience leads such engineers to create
heterogeneous solutions that they glue together with scripting languages such
as Bash, PowerShell, Python, a bit of praying, some saliva and hope.

Enterprises with serious needs to improve their engineering processes should
instead focus on hiring software engineers with a side interest in solving
development processes issues, a practice that Google pioneered and made popular
with their Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) role.
