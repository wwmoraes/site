Here's my personal technology radar. Its inspired by the [Thoughtworks one](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar).

A key difference is that the entries here are based on my personal preferences,
experience and perceived value. They neither reflect the opinions of my current
nor previous employers. Tiers and their meanings are:

- **Adopt**: Preferred. Used consistently when possible/applicable
- **Trial**: Seems valuable. Needs more real world opportunities to evaluate
- **Assess**: Interesting. Needs a MVP/PoC to gain practical experience
- **Hold**: Best avoided. May have niche uses. Think thrice before using it

Click on a blip or on a list entry for details about my reasoning to classify
it that way. Missing something in particular? I may forgot it or am just lazy
to add more. I appreciate any reminders or pointers to further update it!

Take it all with a grain of salt. ðŸ˜‰
