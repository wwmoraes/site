I work at companies of all sizes, from startups to corporations. Currently I'm
leading a service-oriented architecture platform initiative at ABN AMRO Bank in
the Netherlands.

My focus lies on both backend coding and system architecture, where I apply
domain-driven design principles. Understanding contexts helps me discuss
with teams about solution boundaries and how we can deliver value with good
throughput and quality.

On the management side I like to jot down a bit of enterprise architecture to
find out drivers, stakeholders, objectives and goals. This gives me a hollistic
view of what value truly means to the business and how to create bottom-up
initiatives effectively.

Personally I'm quite snarky and stoic, described as cheeky by some peers. I
tend to share my opinions and thoughts freely with teammates and stakeholders.
Beating around the bush wastes time, our most precious resource.
