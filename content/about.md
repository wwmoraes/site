## Hello there 👋

I'm William, a software engineer passionate about automation. I constantly code my way out of toil tasks. My goal is that I'm not needed so I can move on. I prefer education over abstraction to keep processes simple. Trying to obscure them leads to the opposite.

Snarky and stoic by nature, described as cheeky by peers. I tend to share my opinions and thoughts freely with teammates and stakeholders. Beating around the bush wastes time, and that's our most precious resource.

Check out what I'm up to right [now](/now). You can also follow my [RSS](/index.rss.xml)/[JSON](/index.feed.json) feed for updates.
