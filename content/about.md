## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm William, a software engineer passionate about automation. I constantly
code my way out of toil tasks. My goal is that I'm not needed so I can move on.
I prefer education over abstraction to ease processes. Trying to obscure them
leads to the opposite.

Snarky and stoic by nature, described as cheeky by peers. I tend to share my
opinions and thoughts freely with teammates and stakeholders. Beating around
the bush wastes time, our most precious resource.

Want to know more? Have an inside look into my personal research references and
interests through my [Zotero web library][zot-lib]. There's a list of books and
research topics in my [now](/now) page as well ;)

You can follow this site updates through [RSS](/index.rss.xml) and
