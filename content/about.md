## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm William, a software engineer passionate about automation. I constantly
code my way out of toil tasks. My goal is that I'm not needed so I can move on.
I prefer education over abstraction to ease processes. Trying to obscure them
leads to the opposite.

Snarky and stoic by nature, described as cheeky by peers. I tend to share my
opinions and thoughts freely with teammates and stakeholders. Beating around
the bush wastes time, our most precious resource.

Check out what I'm up to right [now](/now). You can also follow my
[RSS](/index.rss.xml)/[JSON](/index.feed.json) feed for updates.
